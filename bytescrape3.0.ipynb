       "  'First, I wanna say I love the open mindedness of the previous replies, the negative things I see in people’s comments about tiktokers invading and whatnot isn’t representative of what the byte community is about. For the most part, we’re about acceptance and support towards good content that both creators and viewers enjoy, which I love.\\nSo, I feel that tiktokers should be welcome too, and hopefully they’ll grow to love byte the way it is and just as much as we do, and maybe be inspired to make and support different kinds of content.',\n",
       "  'I don’t mind people from Tiktok on Byte, but they need to realize that Byte is way different than Tiktok.\\nTo me, the way Tiktok runs on trends is like a popularity contest.  You can get a good amount of views easily for doing a trend, but the best looking/most popular people doing the same trend you did will get the most views and followers overall.\\nByte, on the other hand, is more of a work for your views thing.  Most of the time, you have to put out good content that people are going to like and view a lot for you to get views and followers.  You definitely get less views on Byte than you would on Tiktok.\\nKnowing this, I just don’t want Byte to turn into a mini Tiktok, but I always will welcome people from Tiktok if they understand the difference.',\n",
       "  'It’s very welcomed. Actually @dom was a huge advocate for telling everyone in byte to stop trashing tiktokers. I don’t personally care and I bet the vast majority of people on byte WANT people to come and stay with byte.\\nBut byte and TikTok is not the same. It might have similarities but byte is building a community. Those of us willing to stick around through the good times and bad are gonna see a very beautiful result.

If 2 cities have similar demographics they choose by convention center. A lot of stuff goes in to this such as price/size comparison, but most importantly is their reputation. Special Guests go to a lot of conventions and learn which are good and which are bad.

As a result, I have 5 videos queued up to release, and at least another 5 or so to film. If I continue in my good period, I’ll strategically pick which ones to upload when, and deepen the number of videos that I have so that when I invariably hit a rough patch where I’m too tired or need to focus on my mental health, I have some content to put out.\\nOutside of that- I’m going to use an exercise comparison, and for that I’m already going to apologize. I enjoy exercise for the most part. I also HATE hyping myself up and actually getting to the exercising bit. So I trick myself. I tell myself I’m putting my shoes on for something else. I step on the treadmill to check if it works. I tell myself that this one song will be the only one. Then the next. Obviously, this only works for the milder patches. If you cannot move yourself out of bed- I understand. Take the time, if life affords you. Listen to a podcast or audio tape or watch your favourite comedian or movie.\\nThat being said- your mental well being comes first. Don’t force anything for something recreational if it will end up negatively impacting you. Maybe take some time out to simply consume content if that works for you.

I also want to congratulate @genemachine for winning my heart over for the donation. I will be donating $100 to the Riley Hospital for Children.\\nI gotta be honest… in the beginning of this I wasn’t sure how many people were gonna compete, submit, or be interested. But the support and submissions have absolutely blown me away. All of the interest and submissions has also made it near impossible to select only ten top loops, but I made some tough decisions and now have the list before you. You should all be proud of the loops you made, whether you see them up on the top ten or not. Seriously, thank you guys so much for making this contest such a blast.\\nThe poll will be up until Thursday July 30th, and the top three winners will be announced via Byte and on here. In the case of a tie for the top three positions, I will have the tied members both submit to be either rock, paper, or scissors to “fairly” decide the winner.\\nHere are your top ten:\\nWolfharrington 62\\nbradleywithane 48\\nBeegenics 48\\nSymphonicron 48\\njordan_presley 49\\ndasha 46\\ncubeofcheese 43\\nedwinnboi 45\\nkwrrk 47\\nstardustnow 48\\nPlease click on the names above to watch the top ten post and vote below for who you think deserves the number one spot!\\n Wolfharrington bradleywithane Beegenics Symphonicron jordan_presley dasha cubeofcheese edwinnboi kwrrk stardustnow59votersResults will be shown once closed.\\nAlso, here are a few honorable mentions that were very close to making the top ten:\\nthecatholicchurch 24\\nkarielea2 21\\nGuert 22\\nAgain, thank you all for making this contest so great!',\n",
