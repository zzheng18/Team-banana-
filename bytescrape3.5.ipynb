Vine did this as well.\\nBecause of this, you will generally experience that some of your audio is “cut off” or garbled when you import it. If you have audio that is already designed to loop perfectly, you can make the following changes to get a near perfect loop:\\nTechnique 1 for 30 FPS videos\\nAdd 3 frames (aka 0.1s) to both the beginning and end of the video.\\nTechnique 2 for 60 FPS videos\\nAdd 6 frames (aka 0.1s) to both the beginning and end of the video.\\nTechnique 3 (for complex audio, non-30/60 FPS video, or if the above doesn’t work)\\n\\nStart with your intended audio loop, and make sure it’s no longer than 7.8s\\nCopy 150ms of audio from the beginning of the loop and append it to the end\\n\\nAssuming you started with a 7.8s file, it should now be 7.95s\\nAdd 50ms of silence to the beginning of the file\\nThe file should now be 8s\\n\\nUse this audio as the basis for your video (and make sure the video track is the same length as the final audio file), and you should get a near perfect audio loop.\\nWe’ll work on making this easier and less necessary in the future.',\n",

When I’m filled with energy or in a good place, I create. As much as I can.\\nAn example of that currently- I’ve had a really, really good week. As a result, I have 5 videos queued up to release, and at least another 5 or so to film. If I continue in my good period, I’ll strategically pick which ones to upload when, and deepen the number of videos that I have so that when I invariably hit a rough patch where I’m too tired or need to focus on my mental health, I have some content to put out.\\nOutside of that- I’m going to use an exercise comparison, and for that I’m already going to apologize. I enjoy exercise for the most part. I also HATE hyping myself up and actually getting to the exercising bit. So I trick myself. I tell myself I’m putting my shoes on for something else. I step on the treadmill to check if it works. I tell myself that this one song will be the only one. Then the next. Obviously, this only works for the milder patches. If you cannot move yourself out of bed- I understand. Take the time, if life affords you. Listen to a podcast or audio tape or watch your favourite comedian or movie.\\nThat being said- your mental well being comes first. Don’t force anything for something recreational if it will end up negatively impacting you. Maybe take some time out to simply consume content if that works for you.

Discovering new people, commenting, encouraging, sharing cool stuff with whoever will listen.  It’s two-fold.  One, I’m still maintaining a positive presence on the app, and two it’s a healthy distraction.  Seeing new things feeds the creative reserves that have run dry.

Most of the time, you have to put out good content that people are going to like and view a lot for you to get views and followers.

       "  'First off congrats!\\nI finished my first semester of college back in May, and here are my tips:\\n\\n\\nIf you have questions, don’t be afraid to ask. Most professors really do want to help you, and being the introvert I am I had to break out of my shell to ask questions only to find that my professors were very knowledgeable in their subject and were very willing to help me.\\n\\n\\nBalance out your courses well. I took 17 credits my first semester. Was it difficult? Absolutely. But fortunately for the next semester I only have to take 13 credits, and I have the rest of my courses planned out so that I’ll finish my associate’s in exactly 2 years. So if you need to make a plan for which courses you want to take during which semester, do it. It’ll be really helpful in the long run.\\n\\n\\nAlways check around for the BEST price for your textbook. I initially bought one of my textbooks for over $100 in print only to later refund it and get a digital copy for only $15.  Don’t waste your money on overpriced textbooks; if you can find them cheaper digitally or used, get them that way instead of brand new.\\n\\n\\nI don’t know how relevant this advice will be due to our current global situation, but if you register for in-person classes, make sure to give yourself enough time to get from one class to another. Find the campus maps and trace your route from one classroom to another. I had 15 minutes to walk a little over a quarter of a mile from one classroom to another, which consisted of going down two flights of stairs then going up three more. It was good exercise, but I was still winded by the end of it. So if and/or when you plan to attend on campus, make sure to plot out your route so that not only do you not get lost, but you also know if you have enough time to get from one class to another.\\n\\n\\nHope you have a great first semester!
